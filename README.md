# Numerical-Study-of-Rayleigh-B-enard-Convection
 Simulated buoyancy-driven convection using Navier–Stokes and heat transfer equations under Boussinesq approximation. – Analyzed Rayleigh number effects, showing transition from conduction to convection rolls with enhanced heat transfer. – Highlighted practical relevance in atmospheric flows, ocean currents, and thermal management systems.
